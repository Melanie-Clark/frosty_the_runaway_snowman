# Frosty: The runaway snowman!

The aim of the game is to throw snowballs at Frosty the runaway snowman.

Score as many hits as you can in 30 seconds.

But be careful...each time you hit Frosty, he gets faster!


## Gameplay Mechanics:


### Movement
Use the left/right arrow keys to move the snowball at the bottom of the screen.
Press SPACEBAR to throw the snowball.
Press P to Play or Q to Quit.

### Health

The game starts with five health hearts in the top-left corner of the screen.

Hitting an obstacle (Santa, Elf, Reindeer, Bunny) reduces health by one heart.


### Timer
The player has 30 seconds to score as many hits on Frosty as possible.

### Scoring

**Health Bonus:**
Earn **1 bonus point** for every health heart left at the end of the game.

The total score is calculated by adding the number of Frosty hits to the Health Bonus.
